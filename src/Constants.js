        `Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Ethan Perry, and I am a computer science student from Colorado School 
        of Mines. Curious, driven, and passionate are three words which describe me best.`,
        `In my free time, I love to hike, bicycle, go camping, go backpacking, or do just about anything else outdoors. 
        I am an active member of the Club Triathlon Team at Mines and do several triathlons across the country with the team 
        each semester. In addition, I love playing and listening to music—I try to play or compose whenever I can.`,
        `Of course, I am all things computer science—not only coding, but learning and investigating new technologies, 
        research, and projects that are continually bombarding the public.`,
